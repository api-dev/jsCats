jsCats
======

Javascript experiments and learning projects utilizing the Petfinder API
Each sub-folder is a slightly different version of the same project - a browsing widget for cats available at the House of Mews in Memphis, TN.
The plan is to eventually have different version demonstrating features and code from
* AngularJS
* Backbone.js
* Sencha Touch

## ngCatsHOM
This iteration of jsCats closely reproduces the Flex based widget on www.houseofmews.com
It is written using AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap and features a service module and two controllers.
An example is viewable at http://ericterpstra.com/apps/jsCats/jsCatsHOM/
